## NostoKeeb
NostoKeeb (নষ্ট (Bangla): Rotten) is an on screen keyboard program written in gtkmm-3

### Why?
Onboard was crashing on LightDM login prompt, locking me out of my computer as my keyboard is broken. So, obviously, I proceeded to write this program instead of actually fixing the issue with Onboard.

### To-do
[ ] Make `Ctrl`, `Shift` and `Alt` functional
[ ] Add indicators for `CapsLock`, `Shift`, `Ctrl` and `Alt`
